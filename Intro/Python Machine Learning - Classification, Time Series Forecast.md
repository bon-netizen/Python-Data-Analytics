# About this course

Practice is always the first important things in growing yourself towards data scientist. Althong Python is very good for learning as it is easy for understanding, easy to read the programming code, but still practice is the key to achieve success.
Learn and know the knowledge can not make it part of you. Practice helps on that, it will make the knowledge finally become part of you.
We will practice with various datasets, various packages, not just using pandas, but also many others like scikit-learn, scipy, etc.
Please learn Python programming language, also learn basic regarding how to use numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
